        Assumes that the network has been compiled.

        Graphics display in all blocks can be disabled using the `graphics`
        option to the ``BlockDiagram`` instance.


        Results are returned in a class with attributes:

        - ``t`` the time vector: ndarray, shape=(M,)
        - ``x`` is the state vector: ndarray, shape=(M,N)
        - ``xnames`` is a list of the names of the states corresponding to columns of `x`, eg. "plant.x0",
          defined for the block using the ``snames`` argument
        - ``uN'` for a watched input where N is the index of the port mentioned in the ``watch`` argument
        - ``unames`` is a list of the names of the input ports being watched, same order as in ``watch`` argument

        If there are no dynamic elements in the diagram, ie. no states, then ``x`` and ``xnames`` are not
        present.

        The ``watch`` argument is a list of one or more input ports whose value during simulation
        will be recorded.  The elements of the list can be:
            - a ``Block`` reference, which is interpretted as input port 0
            - a ``Plug`` reference, ie. a block with an index or attribute
            - a string of the form "block[i]" which is port i of the block named block.
